                    <h2> Idea</h2>
                    <p>Time is important. Nowadays it is more important then ever and the phrase time is money is the best way of desribing 21st century. There is a trend towards making life more time-efficient. People do not want just food they want it fast, people don't just want internet they want LTE. People want the service they demand to be fast. Yet, good car wash can't be fast technically and it also takes time spent waiting in the line. That is a very expensive price for 21st century thats why the idea of mobile car wash emerged.<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5565/15115777092_ed771413b5_z.jpg" id='me'></p>

                  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                  <p>The idea is based on creating waterless car wash so there would be no need for the water source. That will make the car wash possible almost at every place where one can get with a car. To substitute the water special chemicals will be used in order to get rid of the dust and polish the car. <img src="http://www.autogaraz.ru/images/stories/auto_pictures/2014/03/suhaya-moyka/suhaya-moyka-2.jpg" id="me"></p>

                     <h2>What is in it for you?</h2>
                     <p>First of all you safe time on the car wash.Second car wash comes to the place you want it to come. Third the chemicals not only clean the car but also polish the car and create a tiny protection layer that will help to keep the car cleaner.Finally it is cheaper then traditional car wash what makes your wallet thicker.</p>
                     <p id="car">Clean car without an effort is a rational choice.
